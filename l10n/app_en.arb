  "privacyFull": "Privacy Policy – SERA\n\nLast updated: 2025-11-29\nApplies to: SERA (iOS, Android and Web)\n\n1. Who is the controller?\n\nCompany: SimlinGroup\nAddress: Ullevivägen 45, 746 51 Bålsta\nEmail: support@sera.chat\n\nWe are responsible for processing personal data when you use SERA.\n\n2. Summary\n• SERA helps you troubleshoot equipment and provides chat functionality.\n• Your chat content and equipment data (e.g., brand, model, year) go via our server (\"proxy\") to a third-party AI provider that uses data from our own knowledge library to generate answers.\n• All traffic uses HTTPS. We do not sell your personal data.\n• You can request deletion of chat logs and exercise GDPR rights (see section 11).\n\n3. What data we collect\n\nDepending on how you use SERA, we may process these categories:\n\nA. User content\n• Text you enter in chat, selected equipment fields (brand, model, year), any attached images/notes.\n\nB. Technical data & logs\n• IP address (in server logs), timestamps, device/browser info (for troubleshooting and security).\n• Crash and performance data if you consent in the app.\n\nC. Account data (if accounts are introduced)\n• Name, email, authentication details, payment-related data (handled via payment partner).\n\nD. Support\n• Messages you send to support and related correspondence.\n\nWe do not collect exact geolocation. Camera access, microphone, notifications, etc. are used only if you explicitly enable such a feature.\n\n4. Why we process data (purpose and legal basis)\n• Deliver the service (contract): Generate answers and troubleshooting steps, store history for you, show sources.\n• Security & abuse prevention (legitimate interest): Detect spam/abuse, protect the system.\n• Improvement & diagnostics (legitimate interest or consent): Performance, crash logs, quality follow-up.\n• Legal obligations: e.g., bookkeeping, handling legal claims.\n• Marketing/communication (consent): Only if you actively agree.\n\n5. How AI answers are generated and how SERA’s knowledge library is used\n\nWhen you use chat, your message and any equipment info are sent to our server/proxy. The proxy forwards necessary content to a third-party AI provider to generate an answer. To improve quality and precision, SERA also uses its own curated knowledge library (\"SERA’s library\").\n\nHow it works (RAG):\n• 1) Your question: Your chat content and selected equipment fields (brand, model, year) are received by our server.\n• 2) Search SERA’s library: Our server searches for relevant excerpts in SERA’s library (e.g., manuals, service bulletins, safety notices, technical facts we are allowed to use).\n• 3) Minimal sharing: Only the necessary excerpts plus your question (and equipment fields) are sent to the AI provider to generate the answer. We do not send entire documents unless needed to fulfill your request.\n• 4) Answer + sources: The AI answer is returned to the app, often with citations to the library sources used.\n\nAbout SERA’s library:\n• Owned and maintained by SERA; contains content we are allowed to use (own, licensed, or legally permitted).\n• Does not contain your personal data. Individual chat content is not added to the library, except possibly in aggregated/anonymized form to improve coverage and quality.\n• The library can be stored and updated independently of your app installation (so you get improvements without updating the app).\n\nThird-party AI provider:\n• Configured so data is not used for general model training where such controls exist.\n• May retain limited logs for a short time to prevent abuse and ensure operation.\n• All communication uses HTTPS.\n\nYour control:\n• Do not share sensitive personal data (e.g., health data, national ID).\n• If you do not want your chat content shared with the AI provider, refrain from using the chat feature; other parts of the app may be limited.\n• You can request deletion of chat logs under GDPR (see §11).\n\n6. Sharing\n\nWe do not sell your personal data. We may share data with:\n• Third-party AI provider (only to generate the answer you request).\n• Infrastructure partners (hosting, CDN, email, log management).\n• Payment partner (if purchases are introduced).\n• Authorities if required by law or to protect rights/safety.\n\nAll parties process data under agreements (e.g., data processing agreements).\n\n7. Transfers outside EU/EEA\n\nSome recipients may be outside the EU/EEA (e.g., US). We use appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC). Contact us for more information.\n\n8. Retention\n• Chat content: By default up to 12 months, or until you delete it in the app or request deletion.\n• Server logs (IP, errors, performance): Up to 90 days for troubleshooting/security.\n• Account data (if applicable): As long as the account is active and thereafter as required by law. We may anonymize/aggregate data for statistics.\n\n9. Security\n\nWe use technical and organizational measures to protect data, including encryption in transit (HTTPS), access controls, and logging. No method is 100% secure, but we continuously improve.\n\n10. Cookies and local storage (Web)\n\nOn the web, we may use necessary cookies and/or localStorage/IndexedDB for settings, session management, and cache. Analytics or marketing cookies are used only if you consent.\n\n11. Your rights (GDPR)\n\nYou have the right to:\n• Access your personal data,\n• Request correction or deletion,\n• Request restriction of processing,\n• Object to processing based on legitimate interest,\n• Data portability in some cases,\n• Withdraw consent when processing is based on consent.\n\nContact us at support@sera.chat. You can also file a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority.\n\n12. Children\n\nSERA is not directed to children. If you believe a child under 16 has provided data, contact us and we will remove it.\n\n13. Your choices and controls\n• You can disable collection of crash/diagnostic data at any time (if available).\n• You can clear chat in the app and ask us to delete associated server logs.\n• AI consent: at first chat use, we show a clear dialog. You can opt out; some features may then be limited.\n\n14. Third-party links and sources\n\nSERA may show source links (e.g., to manuals, documentation). We are not responsible for third-party websites and their policies.\n\n15. Changes\n\nWe may update this policy. The new version will be published here with an updated date. For major changes, we will notify in-app or via email (if available).\n\n16. Contact\n\nQuestions about privacy? Contact: support@sera.chat\nMail: Ullevivägen 45, 746 51 Bålsta",
